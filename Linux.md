The kernel is the heart of the Linux operating system. It manages the resources of Linux such as:

File management
Multitasking
Memory management
I/O management
Process management
Device management
Networking support including IPv4 and IPv6
Advanced features such as virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables etc
The kernel decides who will use these resources and for how long and when. It runs your programs or sets up to execute binary files. The kernel acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and various applications.
